# Line-following-car
A repository with all the code for a line-following car using the Arduino Uno R3. The main objective of the car includes following a simple black line path, navigating up and down a ramp, measure the distance travelled and also stop at a specific distance. 

Aside from the main objectives, the car is also fitted with a Bluetooth module and multiple ultrasonic sensors for various additional features. These includes the ability to control the car wirelessly, object tracking and also edge detection.

The line-following car consists of:
1. Arduino Uno Rev 3
2. L298N Motor Driver
3. Motors and Wheels
4. Optical Encoder
5. LCD Keypad Shield
6. Infrared Sensors
7. MPU-6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
8. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
9. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
